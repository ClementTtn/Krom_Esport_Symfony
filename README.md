This project, carried out as part of a work requested during the 4th semester of my university course, is the site of a French association.

This project is based on a first version of a site created for this same association, developed in MVC. So this is the V2 of this site using Symfony.

The site can be accessed [here](https://krom-esport.fr "Site KROM Esport").

- [Discord](https://discord.gg/4fFW5NP "Discord KROM Esport")
